With this tool you can dump existing files of the famous audio box or create custom ones.

# Custom tag cover

I have added support to generate tag covers that can be used with round custom tags. 
New settings are available in teddyBench.cfg to adjust the cover creation:

  * CacheImageSize
      * Image resolution of cover images
  * CustomTagNonPrintableMargin 
      * Margin that printers can not print on the page in mm
  * CustomTagGapX
      * Horizontal space between two covers in mm
  * CustomTagGapY 
      * Vertical space between two covers in mm
  * CustomTagInitialColumn
  * CustomTagInitialRow
  * CustomTagSize
      * Size of covers in mm
  * CustomTagCoverFilename 
      * Filename of export file for cover
  * CustomTagBacksideFilename
      * Filename of export file for backside
